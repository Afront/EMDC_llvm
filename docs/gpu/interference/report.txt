Analysis of interference 
--------------------------------------------

1. full interference
Two+ functions are invoked at the same time.


2. partial interference
Two+ functions are overlapped but not are invoked at the same time.

Observation 1. High volatility

Observation 2. Spatial variation

Observation 3. Temporal variation
