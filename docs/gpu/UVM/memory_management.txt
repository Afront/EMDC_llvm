- Memory allocation (in high-level)
    - cudaMalloc: on the device
    - cudaMalloc3D: 1D, 2D, or 3D memory objects on the device
    - cudaMalloc3DArray: an array on the device
    - cudaMallocArray: an array on the device
    - cudaMallocHost: page-locked memory on the host
    - cudaMallocManaged: unified memory system
    - cudaMallocMipmappedArray: Mipmaps are pre-calculated, optimized sequences of images
    - cudaMallocPitch: Padding
- Low-level memory management
    - cuMemCreate: Creates a physical memory handle
        - This function takes the handle CUmemGenericAllocationHandle
        - Unlike cuMemAlloc, cuMemCreate only accepts aligned size
