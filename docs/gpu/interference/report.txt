Analysis of interference 
--------------------------------------------

A. full interference
Two+ functions are invoked at the same time.

Measure API level interference
0. Synchronize among #of processes.
   include boost/interprocess/managed_shared_memory.hpp
   1) instanciate barrier using managed_shared_memory with #of processes
   2) atomic descrease the barrier per each process

1. Call the target API
	1) blocked APIs
	2) non-blocked APIs


B. partial interference
Two+ functions are overlapped but not are invoked at the same time.

Observation 1. High volatility

Observation 2. Spatial variation

Observation 3. Temporal variation

Observation 4. Hotspot propagation

Observation 5. Restoring propagation
